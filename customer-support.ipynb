        "\n",
        "Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.\n",

        "We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily."

Once you've created your initial support bot, the next step would be to start [adding evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) so you can confidently improve your system.
